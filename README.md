# Installation

Here is a short guide how to install an unpacked extension on Google Chrome.

1. Open the "Extensions" page (chrome://extensions/) in the browser and turn on the "Developer mode".
2. Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory where the built extension is placed.

See Google's guide on extension development which has detailed steps:

**Important note**

Extensions installed as unpacked aren't updated automatically. To update the extension you should download it and install as unpacked again. Unpacked extensions are installed as separate instances.
